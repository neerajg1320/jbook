Stephen Grider:

Make a change to the project and republish with Lerna. 
Write cells in a format which is more user friendly than current JSON format. We can create a real Javascript file where text editor contents are added as comments and code editor contents are added as code.
The code editor height is fixed. It might be better if we adjust it according to the code in it.
The app is empty when a user first opens a new notebook. Try adding in some default notes.



Neeraj Gupta:
Allow multiple element rendering from code cell. Currently we are rendering only onto '#root'.
